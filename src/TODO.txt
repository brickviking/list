1: Fix the 8-bit problem!! There's no reason it should look butt-ugly under ncurses.
2: get list to actually take note of -c (columns) and -r (rows)
3: add LICENSE to the tarball, or to the SRCDIR to scoop up with the dist tarball.
4: rebase the tarball root to list-${VERSION}/ and source files in list-${VERSION}/src/
